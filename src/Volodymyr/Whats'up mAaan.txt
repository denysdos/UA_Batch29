Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming that aims to protect data by restricting direct access to it from outside the class. Encapsulation is achieved by combining data (instance variables) and behavior (methods) within a single unit called a class, and by controlling access to the instance variables using access modifiers (private, protected, public).

In Java, encapsulation can be achieved by declaring instance variables as private and providing public accessor and mutator methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the values of the instance variables.
